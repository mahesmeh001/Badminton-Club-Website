This is a website I developed for the Badminton Team at UW-Madison. As the Communications Chair for the club, I wanted to centralize information about the club in an easy-to-access manner. I thought about my already existing skill sets in Computer Science and decided I could play to my strengths by creating a website to meet this goal.
